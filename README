This project contains several methods for traffic light
control. General utilities may be found in the tlutils
module, while the main files for each method is prefixed
by "tlcontrol-".

All of the methods will require that the traci package
be located somewhere on the python path. The suggested
method on linux is creating a symlink to it on 
"~/.local/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages/", where X.Y indicates
the installed python version.

For more thorough documentation on each of these, check
python's builtin documentation utilities (e.g. the help
function and pydoc) and invoke the main files with
a "--help" option.

In case something goes terribly (or not so terribly)
wrong, you may find out the author of the files through
the Version Control System, and contact him.
